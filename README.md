# FiveM Auto Merger
This script will allow you to merge your vehicles / packs together, as long as they follow the template below:

Main Folder:
  (STREAM FOLDER)
  vehicle.meta
  handling.meta
  carvariations.meta
  carcols.meta
  
Stream Folder: 
  YTD / YFT Files
  
 
 
 Installation Instructions:
 1. Ensure you have Node.JS and NPM installed on your machine
 2. Open script.js in a compiler of your choice. I use VS Code.
 3. Run *npm i* or *npm install* in the directory of your installation.
 4. Insert your vehicles in the *car1* and *car2* folders. Make sure they follow the format above or else it won't work!
 5. As long as there aren't any errors, your merged vehicles, should appear in the *merged* folder. Take them and put them in your server
 6. Remove the *merged* folder ready for your next merging!

If there are any bugs / issues please let me know so I can work on fixing them, or if you know what you're doing, feel free to do them yourself and create a pull request to share with everyone else!
